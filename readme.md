#Dagger 2

Dagger is lagacy, 


primary constructor is invisible

@Inject constructor()

To generate the code we need to create componant interface

required to write abstract function

--> Cannot instanciate using Module and creating provider it can be handle.


--> Interface do not have the constructor injection.

-- We can inject parameter usig field injection as dagger doesn't allow to directly

@Singleton to minimise the recreation of DI
